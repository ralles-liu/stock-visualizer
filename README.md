# stock-visualizer

## Background/Overview

Understanding and digesting historical stock performance is a really important part of making sound future investment decisions. This visualizer will be designed with the goal to make it easy and clear for users to see how their portfolios (actual or hypothetical) are performing. Additionally it will provide various ancillary information such as performance against benchmarks as well as various financial ratios. Users will be able to upload transaction history of stocks they bought/sold at certain prices and the visualizer will properly display all the information.

## Functionality/MVP
Users will be able to:
*	Upload a list of stock transactions in .csv format
*	See his portfolios performance over time as well as relative to other indexes of their choosing 
*	Interact with the graph to shift the time horizon
*	See additional statistics about the portfolio including sector breakout and various financial ratios (ie beta, sharpe ratio)

Additionally the project will include: 

*	A production README
*	Page explaining the general tips to using the visualizer 

## Wireframes

The will be a single page to display the performance, but will have an initial modal type view where the user will update a portfolio. The top of the page will show the actual stock chart along with any comparisons. The user can interact with the top chart to change what data they see.
